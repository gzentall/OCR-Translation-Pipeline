Haci lady! + I wish myself all the best for your short trip. Thank you very much for everything. Unfortunately, various outsiders didn&#39;t want us to see each other before your trip. Nevertheless, I will try to do some productive work for you. 7th evening. Yours, Bob. And so I got the approval for the Flux card. If I have Peats, haugh &amp; apart from that I will have Peatz. So I&#39;ll definitely come with Pempten. By the way, Rob. P. 1.38 ZabÅ«s, andlish your letter arrived yesterday evening. However, I can&#39;t understand why the 10 tapes didn&#39;t get in the mail. Besides, I always wrote immediately when I knew something definitive. = Little one, I won&#39;t moan anymore, but if this continues, I&#39;m ripe for a Verven sanatorium. It&#39;s a shame that so much valuable material is being lost. The three-day journey didn&#39;t bother me at all. I also need three more visas for Hungary, Yugoslavia and Switzerland. The Ingosta visa was rejected yesterday and I have to submit it to Belgrade and that&#39;s taking time. In my desperation I called the Foreign Ministry again. Dr. From called today. I was told that I had come back. I went there straight away, spoke to his representative, had a conversation over the phone and now I&#39;m sitting down in the Foreign Ministry and waiting for the letter they sent me for the National Bank. So I&#39;ll give it one more try and get the flight ticket approved! You won&#39;t be able to find out in the whole of the two until I tell you everything in person. It couldn&#39;t be more complicated. What you know is at most 10% of it. I make it my own. The Verven. version versagu Do you know how happy I would be if I had already put everything in my mind?!!! You can be sure that I&#39;m doing everything. Of course I&#39;ve made mistakes too, but if you write everything down beforehand, - personally. About that and at Troc at From, of course, the telegram that I sent about my visit today was sent through the letter. Little one, please don&#39;t be patient, I&#39;m already tired of it. His Zob.
